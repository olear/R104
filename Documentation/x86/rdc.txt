Introduction
============

RDC (http://www.rdc.com.tw) have been manufacturing x86-compatible SoC
(system-on-chips) for a number of years.  They are not the fastest of
CPUs (clock speeds ranging from 133-150MHz) but 486SX compatibility
coupled with very low power consumption[1] and low cost make them ideal
for embedded applications.


Where to find
=============

RDC chips show up in numerous embedded devices, but be careful since
many of them will not run Linux 2.6 without significant expertise.

There are several variants of what the linux kernel refers to generically
as RDC321X:  R8610, R321x, S3282 and AMRISC20000.

R321x: Found in various routers, see the OpenWrt project for details,
   http://wiki.openwrt.org/oldwiki/rdcport

R8610: Found on the RDC evaluation board
   http://www.ivankuten.com/system-on-chip-soc/rdc-r8610/

AMRISC20000: Found in the MGB-100 wireless hard disk
   http://tintuc.no-ip.com/linux/tipps/mgb100/

S3282: Found in various NAS devices, including the Bifferboard
   http://www.bifferos.com


Kernel Configuration
====================

Add support for this CPU with CONFIG_X86_RDC321X.  Ensure that maths
emulation is included (CONFIG_MATH_EMULATION selected) and avoid MCE
(CONFIG_X86_MCE not selected).


CPU detection
=============

None of these chips support the cpuid instruction, so as with some
other x86 compatible SoCs, we must check the north bridge and look
for specific 'signature' PCI device config.

The current detection code has been tested only on the Bifferboard
(S3282 CPU), please send bug reports or success stories with
other devices to bifferos@yahoo.co.uk.


Credits
=======

Many thanks to RDC for providing the customer codes to allow
detection of all known variants, without which this detection code
would have been very hard to ascertain.
